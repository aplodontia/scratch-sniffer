I haven't been able to get files from the raspberry pi via terminal as I am getting "remote origin already exists" I have tried with my existing repository and a new one as described in the project example. I transfered the other files I created by terminal here by drag and drop. This file was created in GitHub to try and figure out how to get it to sync back to the raspberry.
