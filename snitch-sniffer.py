This is where my mythod code would go for this "snitch-sniffer" project. For now, I'll just copy the text from my README file:
# The Golden Snitch Sniffer
This is a project that uses multiple long-range ultrasonic sensors 
to find and track an object flying in three-dimensional space. 
It displays the object's coordinates, speed, and trajectory 
through a VR headset.
I'm doing some new work on the 'find function' for this project. It will be complicated but I should be able to find some code in other github projects to help.
